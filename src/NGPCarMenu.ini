;
; NGPCarMenu - Plugin for Richard Burns Rally game (1.02 SSE RBR version) to generate car preview images (the actual custom 3D model view in "Select Car" menu)
;              and to show car specs from the current NGP physics model information (NGP specs, longer car model names in RBR menus). 
;
;              https://github.com/mika-n/NGPCarMenu
;
; The original "Select Car" menu in RBR shows preview images and specs of the stock cars. These has nothing to do
; with custom NGP physics (car specs) and 3D car models. This plugin shows the correct preview image and specs for those people
; who use RBR menus to start a race and car (ie. don't use 3rd party launchers).
; 
; Use "Options/Plugins/NGPCarMenu/Create car images" game menu to generate new car preview images (PNG format) if the existing 
; configured NGP car model doesn't have an image in "Select Car" race menu.
; 
; The plugin uses the information from configuration files of RBRCIT tool to read correct car specs (https://github.com/zissakos/RBRCIT).
; You should download and install RBRCIT tool to manage NGP car physics and custom 3D car models, because otherwise this plugin
; cannot find car specifications information (engine, gears, wheels, horsepower, year, FIA category, car model name, etc).
;
; CONFIGURATION OF NGPCarMenu:
;
;   ScreenshotPath        = Location of car preview images (relative to RBR.EXE location or absolute path). Resolution specific subfolder below this folder.
;   ScreenshotFileType    = BMP or PNG (the plugin reads and writes screenshot files in this format)
;   ScreenshotAPIType     = 0 or 1 (the plugin uses either 0=DirectX or 1=GDI technique while creating the screenshot file. Some PCs may have issues with DirectX interface, while GDI works more reliably (but slower).
;   ScreenshotReplay      = Replay file this plugin uses to generate preview car images.
;   ScreenshotCarPosition = Car position within the replay video while taking the car preview screenshot. (well, not yet implemented. Car position is set in the plugin)
;   ScreenshotCamPosition = Camera position while taking the screenshot (well, not yet implemented. Cam position is set in the plugin)
;
;   RBRCITCarListPath     = Path to the carList.ini file (carList.ini contains NGP car spec information). Both RBRCIT and EasyRBR support uses this path value even when the option says "RBRCIT".
;   EasyRBRPath           = Path to EasyRBR.ini file from EasyRBR car manager installation if EasyRBR is used to setup cars instead of RBRCIT. Comment out this entry if EasyRBR is not used (ie. cars have been setup with RBRCIT or manually)
;
;   ScreenshotCropping    = Cropping rectangle for the screenshot (make it "big enough but not too big" to fill the bottom part of "Select Car" RBR menu).
;                           Value are in pixels "left top right bottom". For example "0 236 1920 780" (without quotes).
;   			    (Pro tip. To find a good ScreenshotCropping rectangle coordinates, take a fullscreen screenshot of the car in 
;                    replay video and then use MS-Paint app to find corner coordinates in pixels to fit the car in a rectangle area).
;
;   CarSelectLeftBlackBar = Optional rectangle black bar to hide the stock RBR "left frame" image in "Select Car" menu (empty string or 0 0 0 0 removes black side bars).
;                           The left pixel position (the first value) in CarSelectionLeftBlackBar defines also the X-position of the car preview image.
;							Users with multiple monitors or virtual desktops may have to tweak these settigs to center the image correctly.
;   CarSelectRightBlackBar= (see above)  (Pro tip. The same pro tip with ScreenshotCropping option works here also)
;
;   Car3DModelInfoPosition= X Y position of the the car 3D model info textbox. If this is empty or missing then the game uses default location. Example "940 600" (without quotes). 
;                           If there is a single value then it is assumed to be just X position and Y position will be at default location. Example "940" (without quotes).
;
; The plugin supports resolution specific preview images. Feel free to add new resolution specific configuration entries if the one you use is missing.

; Uncomment (remove ";" char) the EasyRBRPath line and set path to EasyRBR.ini file if cars have been setup using EasyRBR tool instead of RBRCIT tool.
; RBRCIT tool downloads the NGP carList.ini file (see RBRCITCarListPath entry above), but at the moment EasyRBR doesn't download it.
; EasyRBR users should download the file from http://ly-racing.de/ngp/tools/rbrcit/carlist/carList.ini URL and set the path in RBRCITCarListPath entry above.

; Following entires are horizontal x vertical RBR game resolutions. If your resolution is not there then you should add it and tweak ScreenCropping rectangle location.
; PRO TIP. To find a good ScreenshotCropping rectangle coordinates, take a fullscreen screenshot of the car while NGPCarMenu is generating car preview images 
;          and then use Paint app to find corner coordinates in pixels to fit the car in a rectangle area.
;          The same pro tip appplies to CarSelectLeftRightBlackBar options if you want to hide the annoying "moving" RBR background image.
